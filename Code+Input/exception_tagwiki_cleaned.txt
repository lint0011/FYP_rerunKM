sar	  usage:  . ;. ;  . ;. ;  description:  . ;. ; the  sar  command writes to standard output the contents of selected cumulative activity counters in the operating system. the accounting system, based on the values in the  count  and  interval  parameters, writes information the specified number of times spaced at the specified intervals in seconds. if the  interval  parameter is set to zero, the  sar  command displays the average statistics for the time since the system was started. if the  interval  parameter is specified without the  count  parameter, then reports are generated continuously. the collected data can also be saved in the file specified by the  -o filename  flag, in addition to being displayed onto the screen. if  filename  is omitted,  sar  uses the standard system activity daily data file, the  /var/log/sa/sadd  file, where the  dd  parameter indicates the current day. by default all the data available from the kernel are saved in the data file. . ;. ; the  sar  command extracts and writes to standard output records previously saved in a file. this file can be either the one specified by the  -f  flag or, by default, the standard system activity daily data file. . ;. ; without the  -p  flag, the  sar  command reports system-wide (global among all processors) statistics, which are calculated as averages for values expressed as percentages, and as sums otherwise. if the  -p  flag is given, the  sar  command reports activity which relates to the specified processor or processors. if  -p all  is given, the  sar  command reports statistics for each individual processor and global statistics among all processors. . ;. ; you can select information about specific system activities using flags. not specifying any flags selects only cpu activity. specifying the  -a  flag is equivalent to specifying  -bbdqrrsvwwy -i sum -i xall -n all -u all -p all . . ;. ; the default version of the  sar  command (cpu utilization report) might be one of the first facilities the user runs to begin system activity investigation, because it monitors major system resources. if cpu utilization is near 100 percent (user + nice + system), the workload sampled is cpu-bound. . ;. ; if multiple samples and multiple reports are desired, it is convenient to specify an output file for the  sar  command. run the  sar  command as a background process. the syntax for this is: . ;. ;  . ;. ; all data is captured in binary form and saved to a file ( datafile ). the data can then be selectively displayed with the  sar  command using the  -f  option. set the  interval  and  count  parameters to select  count  records at  interval  second intervals. if the  count  parameter is not set, all the records saved in the file will be selected. collection of data in this manner is useful to characterize system usage over a period of time and determine peak usage hours. . ;. ; note: the  sar  command only reports on local activities. . ;

writeablebitmap	 bitmaps are generally implemented as immutable objects in wpf. what this means is that once you create a  bitmap you can't make any changes to it. you can manipulate bitmaps by creating new versions, which then immediately become immutable and sometimes this is a good way to work.. ;immutable bitmaps can be very efficient unless you want to indulge in a lot of dynamic changes in which case the overhead of creating and destroying them rapidly becomes too expensive. in this situation you need something a little more flexible - the writeablebitmap.. ;the writeablebitmap, as its name suggests, isn't immutable and you can get at its individual pixels and manipulate them as much as you want. this is the ideal way to work when you need dynamic bitmaps. so lets take a look at writeablebitmap, how it works and how to use it to do dynamic things.. ;notice that the writeablebitmap class in silverlight is very different to the same class in wpf.. ;to use writeablebitmap we need to add: . ;. ;  . ;. ; which contains all of the additional bitmap facilities we need.. ;you can create a writeablebitmap in two ways. the most commonly used is to simply specify the size and format of the bitmap: . ;. ;  . ;. ; this specifies a writeablebitmap 100 by 100 pixels with a resolution of 300dpi by 300 dpi using a bgra32 pixel format. each pixel, a 32-bit int, uses a four-byte bgra  that is the pixel is made up of a byte giving the blue, green, red and alpha values. the final parameter is used to specify a palette if the format needs one.. ;you can specify a wide range of formats for the bitmap you create and in each case each pixel takes a given number of bits to represent and you need to find out how the bits allocated to each pixel determine its colour.. ;the second method of creating a writeablebitmap is to base it on an existing bitmapsource or derived class.  for example, you should be able to create a writeablebitmap from a standard bitmap using the constructor:. ;   writeablebitmap(bitmapsource);. ;but if you try this with a bitmapimage loaded from a uri you will   get a null object error. the reason is that the bitmap might not yet be downloaded. for a local file the bitmap load blocks execution until it is loaded: . ;. ;  . ;. ; in this case the writeablebitmap is created with no problems. if the uri was an http url, however, the load would not block the execution and the result would be an error. . ;

markov-models	 markov chain . ;. ; the simplest markov model is the markov chain. it models the state of a system with a random variable that changes through time. in this context, the markov property suggests that the distribution for this variable depends only on the distribution of the previous state. an example use of a markov chain is markov chain monte carlo, which uses the markov property to prove that a particular method for performing a random walk will sample from the joint distribution of a system. . ;. ; hidden markov model . ;. ; a hidden markov model is a markov chain for which the state is only partially observable. in other words, observations are related to the state of the system, but they are typically insufficient to precisely determine the state. several well-known algorithms for hidden markov models exist. for example, given a sequence of observations, the viterbi algorithm will compute the most-likely corresponding sequence of states, the forward algorithm will compute the probability of the sequence of observations, and the baumwelch algorithm will estimate the starting probabilities, the transition function, and the observation function of a hidden markov model.. ;one common use is for speech recognition, where the observed data is the speech audio waveform and the hidden state is the spoken text. in this example, the viterbi algorithm finds the most likely sequence of spoken words given the speech audio. . ;. ; markov decision process . ;. ; a markov decision process is a markov chain in which state transitions depend on the current state and an action vector that is applied to the system. typically, a markov decision process is used to compute a policy of actions that will maximize some utility with respect to expected rewards. it is closely related to reinforcement learning, and can be solved with value iteration and related methods. . ;. ; partially observable markov decision process . ;. ; a partially observable markov decision process (pomdp) is a markov decision process in which the state of the system is only partially observed. pomdps are known to be np complete, but recent approximation techniques have made them useful for a variety of applications, such as controlling simple agents or robots. . ;. ; markov random field . ;. ; a markov random field, or markov network, may be considered to be a generalization of a markov chain in multiple dimensions. in a markov chain, state depends only on the previous state in time, whereas in a markov random field, each state depends on its neighbors in any of multiple directions. a markov random field may be visualized as a field or graph of random variables, where the distribution of each random variable depends on the neighboring variables with which it is connected. more specifically, the joint distribution for any random variable in the graph can be computed as the product of the "clique potentials" of all the cliques in the graph that contain that random variable. modeling a problem as a markov random field is useful because it implies that the joint distributions at each vertex in the graph may be computed in this manner. . ;. ; hierarchical markov models . ;. ; hierarchical markov models can be applied to categorize human behavior at various levels of abstraction. for example, a series of simple observations, such as a person's location in a room, can be interpreted to determine more complex information, such as in what task or activity the person is performing. two kinds of hierarchical markov models are the hierarchical hidden markov model and the abstract hidden markov model. both have been used for behavior recognition, and certain conditional independence properties between different levels of abstraction in the model allow for faster learning and inference. . ;

static-memory-allocation	 in computer programming, a static variable is a variable that has been allocated statically so that its lifetime or "extent" extends across the entire run of the program. this is in contrast to the more ephemeral automatic variables (local variables are generally automatic), whose storage is allocated and deallocated on the call stack; and in contrast to objects whose storage is dynamically allocated in heap memory. static memory allocation in general is the allocation of memory at compile time before the associated program is executed, unlike dynamic memory allocation or automatic memory allocation where memory is allocated as required at run time. . ;. ; the absolute address addressing mode can only be used with static variables, because those are the only kinds of variables whose location is known by the compiler at compile time. when the program (executable or library) is loaded into memory, static variables are stored in the data segment of the program's address space (if initialized), or the bss segment (if uninitialized), and are stored in corresponding sections of object files prior to loading. . ;. ; the static keyword is used in c and related languages both for static variables and other concepts. . ;. ; source:  wikipedia  . ;

angularjs-sce	 strict contextual escaping (sce) is a mode in which angularjs requires bindings in certain contexts to result in a value that is marked as safe to use for that context. one example of such a context is binding arbitrary html controlled by the user via ng-bind-html. we refer to these contexts as privileged or sce contexts. . ;. ; as of version 1.2, angular ships with sce enabled by default. . ;. ; note: when enabled (the default), ie 11 in quirks mode is not supported. in this mode, ie 11 allow one to execute arbitrary javascript by the use of the expression() syntax. refer to learn more about them. you can ensure your document is in standards mode and not quirks mode by adding  to the top of your html document. . ;. ; sce assists in writing code in way that (a) is secure by default and (b) makes auditing for security vulnerabilities such as xss, clickjacking, etc. a lot easier. . ;. ; here's an example of a binding in a privileged context: . ;. ;  . ;. ; notice that ng-bind-html is bound to userhtml controlled by the user. with sce disabled, this application allows the user to render arbitrary html into the div. in a more realistic example, one may be rendering user comments, blog articles, etc. via bindings. (html is just one example of a context where rendering user controlled input creates security vulnerabilities.) . ;. ; for the case of html, you might use a library, either on the client side, or on the server side, to sanitize unsafe html before binding to the value and rendering it in the document. . ;. ; how would you ensure that every place that used these types of bindings was bound to a value that was sanitized by your library (or returned as safe for rendering by your server?) how can you ensure that you didn't accidentally delete the line that sanitized the value, or renamed some properties/fields and forgot to update the binding to the sanitized value? . ;. ; to be secure by default, you want to ensure that any such bindings are disallowed unless you can determine that something explicitly says it's safe to use a value for binding in that context. you can then audit your code (a simple grep would do) to ensure that this is only done for those values that you can easily tell are safe - because they were received from your server, sanitized by your library, etc. you can organize your codebase to help with this - perhaps allowing only the files in a specific directory to do this. ensuring that the internal api exposed by that code doesn't markup arbitrary values as safe then becomes a more manageable task. . ;. ; in the case of angularjs' sce service, one uses $sce.trustas (and shorthand methods such as $sce.trustashtml, etc.) to obtain values that will be accepted by sce / privileged contexts. . ;

javascript-oscillator	 in molecular biology, an oscillating gene is a gene that is expressed in a rhythmic pattern or in periodic cycles.[1][2] oscillating genes are usually circadian and can be identified by periodic changes in the state of an organism. circadian rhythms, controlled by oscillating genes, have a period of approximately 24 hours. for example, plant leaves opening and closing at different times of the day or the sleep-wake schedule of animals can all include circadian rhythms. other periods are also possible, such as 29.5 days resulting from circalunar rhythms or 12.4 hours resulting from circatidal rhythms.[3] oscillating genes include both core clock component genes and output genes. a core clock component gene is a gene necessary for to the pacemaker. however, an output oscillating gene, such as the avp gene, is rhythmic but not necessary to the pacemaker.[4] . ;

pedometer	 a pedometer is a device, usually portable and electronic or electromechanical, that counts each step a person takes by detecting the motion of the person's hands or hips. because the distance of each person's step varies, an informal calibration, performed by the user, is required if presentation of the distance covered in a unit of length (such as in kilometers or miles) is desired, though there are now pedometers that use electronics and software to automatically determine how a person's step varies. distance traveled (by walking or any other means) can be measured directly by a gps tracker. . ;. ; used originally by sports and physical fitness enthusiasts, pedometers are now becoming popular as an everyday exercise counter and motivator. often worn on the belt and kept on all day, it can record how many steps the wearer has walked that day, and thus the kilometers or miles (distance = number of steps × step length). some pedometers will also erroneously record movements other than walking, such as bending to tie one's shoes, or road bumps incurred while riding a vehicle, though the most advanced devices record fewer of these 'false steps'. step counters can give encouragement to compete with oneself in getting fit and losing weight. a total of 10,000 steps per day, equivalent to 8 kilometres (5.0 mi), is recommended by some to be the benchmark for an active lifestyle, although this point is debated among experts. thirty minutes of moderate walking are equivalent to 3,000-4,000 steps as determined by a pedometer. step counters are being integrated into an increasing number of portable consumer electronic devices such as music players, smartphones, and mobile phones. . ;. ; from wikipedia:     . ;
