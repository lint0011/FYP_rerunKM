sar	ide	  usage:  . ;. ;  . ;. ;  description:  . ;. ; the  sar  command writes to standard output the contents of selected cumulative activity counters in the operating system. the accounting system, based on the values in the  count  and  interval  parameters, writes information the specified number of times spaced at the specified intervals in seconds. if the  interval  parameter is set to zero, the  sar  command displays the average statistics for the time since the system was started. if the  interval  parameter is specified without the  count  parameter, then reports are generated continuously. the collected data can also be saved in the file specified by the  -o filename  flag, in addition to being displayed onto the screen. if  filename  is omitted,  sar  uses the standard system activity daily data file, the  /var/log/sa/sadd  file, where the  dd  parameter indicates the current day. by default all the data available from the kernel are saved in the data file. . ;. ; the  sar  command extracts and writes to standard output records previously saved in a file. this file can be either the one specified by the  -f  flag or, by default, the standard system activity daily data file. . ;. ; without the  -p  flag, the  sar  command reports system-wide (global among all processors) statistics, which are calculated as averages for values expressed as percentages, and as sums otherwise. if the  -p  flag is given, the  sar  command reports activity which relates to the specified processor or processors. if  -p all  is given, the  sar  command reports statistics for each individual processor and global statistics among all processors. . ;. ; you can select information about specific system activities using flags. not specifying any flags selects only cpu activity. specifying the  -a  flag is equivalent to specifying  -bbdqrrsvwwy -i sum -i xall -n all -u all -p all . . ;. ; the default version of the  sar  command (cpu utilization report) might be one of the first facilities the user runs to begin system activity investigation, because it monitors major system resources. if cpu utilization is near 100 percent (user + nice + system), the workload sampled is cpu-bound. . ;. ; if multiple samples and multiple reports are desired, it is convenient to specify an output file for the  sar  command. run the  sar  command as a background process. the syntax for this is: . ;. ;  . ;. ; all data is captured in binary form and saved to a file ( datafile ). the data can then be selectively displayed with the  sar  command using the  -f  option. set the  interval  and  count  parameters to select  count  records at  interval  second intervals. if the  count  parameter is not set, all the records saved in the file will be selected. collection of data in this manner is useful to characterize system usage over a period of time and determine peak usage hours. . ;. ; note: the  sar  command only reports on local activities. . ;

markov-models	field	 markov chain . ;. ; the simplest markov model is the markov chain. it models the state of a system with a random variable that changes through time. in this context, the markov property suggests that the distribution for this variable depends only on the distribution of the previous state. an example use of a markov chain is markov chain monte carlo, which uses the markov property to prove that a particular method for performing a random walk will sample from the joint distribution of a system. . ;. ; hidden markov model . ;. ; a hidden markov model is a markov chain for which the state is only partially observable. in other words, observations are related to the state of the system, but they are typically insufficient to precisely determine the state. several well-known algorithms for hidden markov models exist. for example, given a sequence of observations, the viterbi algorithm will compute the most-likely corresponding sequence of states, the forward algorithm will compute the probability of the sequence of observations, and the baumwelch algorithm will estimate the starting probabilities, the transition function, and the observation function of a hidden markov model.. ;one common use is for speech recognition, where the observed data is the speech audio waveform and the hidden state is the spoken text. in this example, the viterbi algorithm finds the most likely sequence of spoken words given the speech audio. . ;. ; markov decision process . ;. ; a markov decision process is a markov chain in which state transitions depend on the current state and an action vector that is applied to the system. typically, a markov decision process is used to compute a policy of actions that will maximize some utility with respect to expected rewards. it is closely related to reinforcement learning, and can be solved with value iteration and related methods. . ;. ; partially observable markov decision process . ;. ; a partially observable markov decision process (pomdp) is a markov decision process in which the state of the system is only partially observed. pomdps are known to be np complete, but recent approximation techniques have made them useful for a variety of applications, such as controlling simple agents or robots. . ;. ; markov random field . ;. ; a markov random field, or markov network, may be considered to be a generalization of a markov chain in multiple dimensions. in a markov chain, state depends only on the previous state in time, whereas in a markov random field, each state depends on its neighbors in any of multiple directions. a markov random field may be visualized as a field or graph of random variables, where the distribution of each random variable depends on the neighboring variables with which it is connected. more specifically, the joint distribution for any random variable in the graph can be computed as the product of the "clique potentials" of all the cliques in the graph that contain that random variable. modeling a problem as a markov random field is useful because it implies that the joint distributions at each vertex in the graph may be computed in this manner. . ;. ; hierarchical markov models . ;. ; hierarchical markov models can be applied to categorize human behavior at various levels of abstraction. for example, a series of simple observations, such as a person's location in a room, can be interpreted to determine more complex information, such as in what task or activity the person is performing. two kinds of hierarchical markov models are the hierarchical hidden markov model and the abstract hidden markov model. both have been used for behavior recognition, and certain conditional independence properties between different levels of abstraction in the model allow for faster learning and inference. . ;

pedometer	call	 a pedometer is a device, usually portable and electronic or electromechanical, that counts each step a person takes by detecting the motion of the person's hands or hips. because the distance of each person's step varies, an informal calibration, performed by the user, is required if presentation of the distance covered in a unit of length (such as in kilometers or miles) is desired, though there are now pedometers that use electronics and software to automatically determine how a person's step varies. distance traveled (by walking or any other means) can be measured directly by a gps tracker. . ;. ; used originally by sports and physical fitness enthusiasts, pedometers are now becoming popular as an everyday exercise counter and motivator. often worn on the belt and kept on all day, it can record how many steps the wearer has walked that day, and thus the kilometers or miles (distance = number of steps × step length). some pedometers will also erroneously record movements other than walking, such as bending to tie one's shoes, or road bumps incurred while riding a vehicle, though the most advanced devices record fewer of these 'false steps'. step counters can give encouragement to compete with oneself in getting fit and losing weight. a total of 10,000 steps per day, equivalent to 8 kilometres (5.0 mi), is recommended by some to be the benchmark for an active lifestyle, although this point is debated among experts. thirty minutes of moderate walking are equivalent to 3,000-4,000 steps as determined by a pedometer. step counters are being integrated into an increasing number of portable consumer electronic devices such as music players, smartphones, and mobile phones. . ;. ; from wikipedia:     . ;
